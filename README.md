Porto Seguro, one of Brazil’s largest auto and homeowner insurance companies, completely agrees that inaccuracies in car insurance company’s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones.

In this project, a model was built that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. 

Several models were tried such as Neural Network, XGBoost etc.
